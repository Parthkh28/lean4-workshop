* Official Resources

** Primary Learning Paths

*** Functional Programming in Lean (FPIL)
- URL: https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/
- Audience: Programmers new to functional programming
- Focus: Learn Lean as a programming language

*** Theorem Proving in Lean 4 (TPIL)
- URL: https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/
- Audience: Those interested in formal proofs
- Focus: Dependent type theory, proof tactics

*** Mathematics in Lean (MIL)
- URL: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/
- Audience: Mathematicians
- Focus: Mathlib library, formal mathematics

* Interactive Games (Fun Approaches)

** Lean Game Server
URL: https://adam.math.hhu.de/

Available games:
- Natural Number Game (NNG4) - Prove 2+2=4 and beyond
- Set Theory Game
- Logic Game
- Robo - A story about undergrad mathematics

Play NNG4: https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/NNG4

** Why Games?

Learning Lean "takes time" and can be "frustrating" - games help!
The NNG teaches induction and basic tactics through puzzles.

* Quick References

** Learn X in Y Minutes
- URL: https://learnxinyminutes.com/lean4/
- Compact syntax overview

** Tactic Cheatsheet
- PDF available from leanprover-community
- Common tactics reference

* Editor Setup

** VS Code (Recommended)
Install the lean4 extension from marketplace.

** Emacs (lean4-mode)
- Repository: https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode
- Requires: Emacs 27+, lsp-mode, dash, magit-section

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Doom Emacs
;; In packages.el:
(package! lean4-mode
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "leanprover-community/lean4-mode"
           :files ("*.el" "data")))

;; Standard use-package with straight.el
(use-package lean4-mode
  :commands lean4-mode
  :straight (lean4-mode
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "leanprover-community/lean4-mode"
             :files ("*.el" "data")))
#+END_SRC

Key bindings:
- ~C-c C-i~ : Toggle info view (proof state)

* Toolchain

** Current Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gmake deps  # Check your tools
#+END_SRC

* Amusing Learning Resources

** O(1) Sort - The Identity Function as "Valid Sort"
A satirical proof demonstrating why specification matters:

#+BEGIN_SRC lean4
-- "It was already sorted in my heart"
def sort {α : Type} : List α → List α := fun x => x

-- Proves idempotence, sum preservation, permutation...
-- But NOT actually sorted!
-- Moral: Verify the RIGHT properties
#+END_SRC

Key lesson: Formal verification proves code matches spec.
It doesn't prove your spec is what you wanted.

* Workshop Project Ideas

1. Natural Number Game completion
2. Implement and prove basic list operations
3. Formalize a small mathematical structure
4. Veil DSL security properties (advanced)

* Local Variables
